IRC-Client
==========

A thin client for irc chat.  You can log onto your favorite irc-channel from you commandline to send a quick
message or two.  Or for common use if you prefer the terminal to another interface.

You can send and receive standard messages with a handful of other commands.

When joining another channel you will automatically part from you current channel if any.
