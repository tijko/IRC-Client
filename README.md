IRC-Client
==========

A thin client for irc chat on freenode.net. This client has a very barebones interface
using Tkinter but, has some text highlighting applied for different messages.

IRC-Client only allows chatting on one channel at a time, so no other channel-tabs right now.

#### usage

When inputting any command use a backslash then the command you wish to call,
entering `/help` will show all other available commands:

    Commands <<<help - links - topic - unblock - names - reconnect - quit - pause - 
                stats - whois - nick - version - whereami - noise - msg - part - whatis -
                log - info - join - blocklist - list - whowas - whoami - block>>>

You can also use `/help <command>` for any valid command you want to see how to use or
what it does.
